                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    The Seattle Food Equity Map is an interactive web application that challenges conventional 
                    food desert mapping by incorporating economic accessibility alongside geographic proximity. 
                    While traditional approaches like the USDA Food Access Research Atlas identify areas with 
                    limited supermarket access, our project reveals a more nuanced reality: many neighborhoods 
                    have stores nearby, but lack access to affordable options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By classifying grocery stores into three price tiers—Budget ($), Mid-Range ($$), and 
                    Premium ($$$)—we provide policymakers, community organizations, and residents with 
                    actionable insights about where affordable food options are truly lacking.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <div class="approach-grid">
                    <div class="approach-item">
                        <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
                        <p>
                            We compiled data from multiple authoritative sources: the USDA Food Access Research 
                            Atlas (2019), Seattle Active Business License database, US Census TIGER/Line shapefiles, 
                            and Seattle's emergency food provider listings.

                        <h3>2. Manual Classification</h3>
                        <p>
                            Each grocery store and convenience store was manually classified into price tiers 
                            based on market positioning, typical product prices, and brand recognition. This 
                            crucial step adds the "economic access" layer missing from standard food desert maps.

                        <h3>3. Interactive Visualization</h3>
                        <p>
                            Built with Mapbox GL JS, our map allows users to filter stores by price tier, 
                            view emergency food services, calculate distances from their location, and explore 
                            neighborhood-level food access patterns.

                        <h3>4. Critical Analysis</h3>
                        <p>
                            By overlaying income data from the American Community Survey with our price-adjusted 
                            food access layer, we reveal disparities that standard proximity-only models miss.

                            affordable grocers are most needed and where existing "food desert" designations 
                            may mask affordability issues.

                            physical store access but lack economic access, enabling more strategic resource

                    This project was created by Group AB5 as a final project for GEOG 328 at the 
                    University of Washington. Our interdisciplinary team brought together skills in 
                    geographic information systems, web development, data analysis, and urban studies.

                <p>
                    We acknowledge that this analysis builds upon the foundational work of the USDA's 
                    Food Access Research Atlas while seeking to extend it with affordability considerations. 
                    We also recognize the ongoing efforts of Seattle's emergency food providers, whose 
                    locations we've mapped to show the relationship between market gaps and safety-net services.
