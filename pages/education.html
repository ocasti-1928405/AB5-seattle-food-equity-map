                <h2>What Are Food Deserts?</h2>
                <p>
                    The term "food desert" describes geographic areas where residents have limited access 
                    to affordable and nutritious food, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. The USDA 
                    defines food deserts using two key metrics:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low Income:</strong> Census tracts where the poverty rate is 20% or higher, 
                    or median family income is at or below 80% of the area median</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Access:</strong> At least 500 people or 33% of the population live more 
                    than 1 mile (urban) or 10 miles (rural) from the nearest supermarket</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While this framework has been valuable for identifying underserved areas, it treats all 
                    supermarkets equally—assuming that proximity to any store solves the access problem. 
                    Our project challenges this assumption.
                </p>

                <h2>The Problem with Proximity-Only Models</h2>
                <p>
                    Standard food desert mapping focuses solely on distance to stores, missing a critical 
                    dimension: affordability. Consider these scenarios:
                </p>
                <div class="example-grid">
                    <div class="example-card">
                        <h3>Scenario A</h3>
                        <p>
                            A low-income neighborhood has three supermarkets within walking distance, but all 
                            are premium chains with prices 30-50% higher than budget alternatives. Is this 
                            true food access?
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example-card">
                        <h3>Scenario B</h3>
                        <p>
                            A census tract is classified as "food secure" because it has a Whole Foods nearby, 
                            yet the median household income is $35,000 and residents rely heavily on emergency 
                            food services. What does "access" really mean here?
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    These examples illustrate why we need to look beyond proximity and consider economic 
                    accessibility. A store you cannot afford to shop at is not truly "accessible" food.

                <h2>Our Price-Adjusted Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    To address these limitations, we manually classified Seattle's grocery stores and 
                    convenience stores into three price tiers:
                </p>
                <div class="tier-explanation">
                    <div class="tier-card budget">
                        <h3>Budget ($)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> WinCo Foods, Food Depot, local ethnic grocery stores, 
                        discount chains</p>
                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Lowest prices, bulk options, limited prepared foods, 
                        may have fewer "premium" brands but provide essential nutrition at accessible price points</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tier-card mid-range">
                        <h3>Mid-Range ($$)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Safeway, Fred Meyer, QFC, regional chains</p>
                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Moderate prices, balance of store brands and national 
                        brands, regular sales, loyalty programs, diverse product selection</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tier-card premium">
                        <h3>Premium ($$$)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Whole Foods, PCC Community Markets, Metropolitan Market</p>
                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Highest prices, emphasis on organic/specialty items, 
                        extensive prepared foods, premium brands, specialized dietary options</p>

                <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                <p>
                    By layering our price-tier classification with income data from the American Community 
                    Survey, several patterns emerge:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Economic Deserts vs. Geographic Deserts:</strong> Some areas technically have 
                        food access by proximity measures but lack affordable options relative to local incomes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Emergency Food Correlation:</strong> Neighborhoods with higher ratios of premium 
                        to budget stores often show higher density of emergency food providers, suggesting that 
                        market failure creates dependency on safety-net services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Transit-Dependent Populations:</strong> For residents without cars, distance to 
                        affordable options matters even more. A mile walk carrying groceries is very different 
                        from a mile drive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cultural Food Access:</strong> Budget stores often include ethnic grocers that 
                        provide culturally relevant foods at lower prices—an aspect entirely missing from 
                        standard food desert metrics.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Classification Methodology:</h3>
                <p>
                    Price tier classifications were assigned through systematic research of each chain's 
                    market positioning, typical product prices compared to Consumer Price Index data, and 
                    community perception. Independent grocers were evaluated individually based on available 
                    pricing information and product offerings.

                <h2>Limitations & Future Work</h2>
                <p>
                    While our approach adds important nuance to food access mapping, we acknowledge several 
                    limitations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Price classifications are categorical and don't capture within-store variation or 
                    temporal price changes</li>
                    <li>We don't account for store size, product variety, or hours of operation</li>
                    <li>Transportation barriers beyond distance (e.g., bus routes, travel time) aren't fully 
                    represented</li>
                    <li>The analysis is static—food access patterns change over time as stores open or close</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Future iterations could incorporate dynamic pricing data, transit network analysis, 
                    store quality metrics, and temporal changes to provide an even richer picture of food equity.
